## Welcome to the Nugent Research Group

We're a research group based out of the University of Hawaii at Manoa, in Honolulu, HI. Run by Dr. Alsion Nugent, the Nugent lab focuses on studying how: 
1. Topography impacts the development of clouds and precipition, and 
2. Aerosol impacts on cloud development and precipitation

Primarily, we're interested in the common theme of shallow convection and precipitation development with applications for short term weather forecasting and long-term climate modeling.
