## Welcome to the Nugent Research Group

The Nugent lab focuses on studying how: 
1. Topography impacts the development of clouds and precipition, and 
2. Aerosol impacts on cloud development and precipitation

Primarily, we're interested in the common theme of shallow convection and precipitation development and has strong implications for short term weather forecasting and long-term climate modeling.  


### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/nugentlab/nugentlab.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
